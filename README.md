## How It Works

### 🎭 Playwright Pricing Service (pricing-service/)

1. **Advanced Scraping** - Uses stealth techniques to avoid detection
2. **Product Page Analysis** - Navigates to individual product pages for accurate pricing
3. **Smart Filtering** - Distinguishes between MP3s, books, and other products
4. **Album Detection** - Automatically finds album prices and track counts
5. **Cost Optimization** - Calculates optimal purchase strategies

### 🔧 Go Purchase Engine

1. **Session Management** - Saves/reuses cookies for authentication
2. **Headless Login** - Automated Amazon login with 2FA support
3. **Purchase Automation** - Handles search, selection, and purchase flow
4. **Error Handling** - Robust retry logic and failure recovery

### 🔗 Integration Layer

- Go CLI delegates pricing operations to Playwright service
- Automatic dependency installation and management
- Unified command-line interface for all operations
- Seamless data passing between Go and Node.js components

```

## Branches

- **`main`** - Hybrid approach (Go + Playwright)
- **`rod`** - Original Go-only implementation with Rod browser automation

## Advanced Usage

### Direct Playwright Service

You can also use the pricing service directly:

```bash
cd pricing-service

# Analyze CSV file
npm run dev -- analyze -i ../sample.csv -o report.json -c report.csv

# Price single track  
npm run dev -- price -a "Taylor Swift" -s "Anti-Hero" --visible

# Install browser dependencies
npm run install-browsers
```

## Security Notes

⚠️ **Important Security Considerations**
- Never commit credentials to version control
- Use environment variables or secure config files
- Keep cookie files secure (they contain session tokens)
- The `.gitignore` prevents accidental credential commits

## Troubleshooting

### Pricing Analysis Issues
- Run with `--headless=false` to see browser behavior
- Check that tracks exist on Amazon Music (not just streaming services)
- Verify CSV format matches expected columns

### Purchase Authentication
- Ensure credentials are correct in config/environment
- Delete `amazon_cookies.json` to force fresh login  
- Handle 2FA by providing `AMAZON_OTP` environment variable

### Dependencies
- Go issues: `go mod tidy && go build`
- Node issues: `cd pricing-service && rm -rf node_modules && npm install`
- Browser issues: `cd pricing-service && npm run install-browsers`

## Performance

- **Pricing Analysis**: ~5-10 seconds per track (rate-limited for stability)
- **Purchase Mode**: ~2-3 seconds per track (with authentication reuse)
- **Concurrent Operations**: Pricing runs single-threaded to avoid detection
